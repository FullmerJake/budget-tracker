  ## Installation
  If you are reading this, you've already found the repo, so good on you for that! Make sure you clone the repo onto your computer. Once you've got it downloaded, if you run npm start in terminal at the root of the project, navigate to localhost//3001. You can access the app that way on a local level. 

  ## Usage
  If you would like to simply use the application instead of working on the code, you can access everything you need at https://limitless-bastion-99274.herokuapp.com/. If there is any information, you can clear data simply by going to application and clearing the storage.

  ## Contribution
  There is always a need to help! I think the next thing I want to work on including is a button that lets to clear everything and start over. Another things that would be an intersting addition would be to create a budget by day function, where you can tab through each day.
